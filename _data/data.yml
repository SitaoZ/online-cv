    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Highly analytical and skilled bioinformatics analyst dealing with biology 
      problems including translational control, lipid metabolism and tumor immunotherapy. Now, I'm 
      a postdoctoral researcher in Wuhan University, and a bioinformatics with 9 years of experience
      in computational biology, intergration algorithms, and genomic datasets. Currently I am 
      exploring statin resistance mechanisms in song lab and developing human diseases cures.

        details: |
          Being a bioinformatics analyst, I collaborated with my colleagues to research in rubber project.
          I fininshed the re-sequencing section independently. I also used WDL and python to construct automatic 
          pipeline in WGS and WES for cancer treatment. I was also involved in the pre-development work of the 
          spatial transcriptome. As a lecturer of BGI College, I am also responsible for the training of college 
          interns from WHU, HUST and HZAU in Wuhan.
            - Analysis of cooperative projects
            - Automatic bioinfomatic pipelines

        company: Genoimmune, BGI
        details: |
          In the department of bioinformatic in Genoimmune, my work mainly includes
          deep learning model building for neoantigen affinity prediction. Meanwhile,
          I also update the EPIP (epitope presentation integrated prediction) software.
            - Building deep learning model in neoantigen affinity prediction
            - Update EPIP, a machine learning software for MHC affinity prediction
